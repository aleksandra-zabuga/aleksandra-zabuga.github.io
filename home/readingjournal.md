These is a list of books I've read through the years. There are technical books here, as well as other literature.
I choose books I read carefully and generally inquire a lot before deciding that it's worth reading.
This is especially true for technical literature, while in the case of fiction this holds to a somewhat lesser extent.

I also recommend these books.
